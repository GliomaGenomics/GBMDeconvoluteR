Bulk expression profiles can be uploaded in **.csv**, **.tsv** or **.xlsx** file formats, with samples in columns and genes in rows. The first column of the data must also contain the gene symbols:

<br/>

<image src= "example_input.png" width = "100%"/>

<br/>

Expression values should be normalised to account for sequencing depth, in either:

 **FPKM** - fragments per kilobase million

 **RPKM** - reads per kilobase million

 **TMP** - transcripts per million

 **CPM** - counts per million

<br/>

All expression values must ***NOT*** be on a logarithmic scale, as they will scaled during scoring.
