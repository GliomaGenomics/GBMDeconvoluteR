**Filtering lowly-expressed genes**

When a new bulk expression dataset is uploaded, any genes which have zero expression across all samples will be filtered out prior to refining the neoplastic cell state marker.

**Scaling & Normalisation**

Expression profiles will be placed into log(base 2) space prior to refining markers and deconvolution.

**Refining Neoplastic Cell-State Markers**

The four neoplastic cell states described be [Neftel et.al (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.06.024), were derived using single cell RNA-Seq data. However, the expression of genes in bulk samples reflects the combined effect from multiple expressing cell types and therefore many genes, which are good markers for a particular cellular state in single cell data may not be good markers in bulk data.

To exclude such genes, we follow the procedure outlined in the paper under the section titled *"Bulk scores defined for TCGA samples"*. Briefly this involves the following steps:

1.  Defined initial bulk scores by the average expression of each neoplastic cell-state.

2.  Calculate the correlation of each neoplastic cell-state gene with the initial scores.

3.  Exclude genes if their correlation is below 0.4 or if the correlation is higher for a different neoplastic cell-state.
