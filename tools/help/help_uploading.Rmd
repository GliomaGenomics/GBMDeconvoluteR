Data can be uploaded as either an Excel spreadsheet or as a delimited file with either tab, comma or semi-colon separators. Samples must be in columns and genes in rows and the first column should contain either gene symbols or gene ENSEMBL IDs:

The expression values should be appropriately normalised to account for sequencing depth, the units for which can be wither ***FPKM*** (fragments per kilobase million); ***TMP*** (transcripts per million) or ***CPM*** (counts per million).

All expression values must unlogged, as they will converted onto a log2 scale during processing.
