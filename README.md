# Overview

GBMDeconvoluteR is a Shiny-based web application for estimating the abundance of immune, stromal and neoplastic cell populations using bulk expression profiles, obtained from grade IV glioblastoma (GBM) samples.

# Usage

To run the hosted version of this application please visit:

<https://gbmdeconvoluter.leeds.ac.uk>

If you wish to run this application on your local machine, this can be easily be done by running first forking this repository and the using the `runGithub()` function from the `shiny` R package.
